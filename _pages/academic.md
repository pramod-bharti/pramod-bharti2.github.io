# Collaborators
I am forever thankful to my collaborators for enabling my scientific journey.
I learned from them a lot, and this helped me shape my academic profile.

**Review processes.** If you are going to invite me to a review process, it is worth to check below list to make sure to maintain a fair review process.
Please also make sure that you understand `my expertise` before inviting me to a review process.
For example, I don't know anything about `sea creatures and their natural habitats` or `lifetime of volcanos`.
